    <h4>Official Description:</h4>
    <p> As the story unfolds, players will encounter the mysterious new Distortion World, an area unlike any seen in a Pokemon video game before. 
        The Battle Frontier area (first introduced in Pokemon Emerald) has been added to Sinnoh, containing five new Battle Facilities for Trainers to challenge, each with its own special rules. 
        Players can explore the new Wi-Fi Plaza a virtual Pokemon amusement park filled with activities, including three new mini-games where up to 4 players can compete at once.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Distortion World</b>: As the story unfolds, players will encounter the mysterious new Distortion World, an area unlike any seen in a Pokemon video game before. The normal rules of time and space don't apply to this world, allowing the area to push the limits of the Pokemon game world. Players leap from pieces of land suspended in midair, walk sideways and even upside-down. The Distortion World, where the powerful Giratina resides, is somehow connected to the regular Pokemon world.</li>
        <li><b>The Battle Frontier</b>: The Battle Frontier area (first introduced in Pokemon Emerald) has been added to Sinnoh, containing five new Battle Facilities for Trainers to challenge, each with its own special rules. Each facility is run by one of five new Frontier Brains (characters that are similar to Gym Leaders). The new battle formats in each facility allow players to challenge themselves in new ways.</li>
        <li><b>Wi-Fi Plaza</b>: Players can explore the new Wi-Fi Plaza a virtual Pokemon amusement park filled with activities, including three new mini-games where up to 4 players can compete at once. Up to 20 players from around the world can connect together in the Wi-Fi Plaza to experience games, take part in parades and even see a fireworks show.</li>
        <li><b>Enhanced Storyline</b>: New characters add to the story, including Charon, a new Commander of the villainous Team Galactic (who is suspicious even by their standards) and an undercover detective, codenamed Looker, who is in pursuit of Team Galactic. Looker will help you throughout your adventure. Team Galactic has a new scheme they've turned their sights on all three Legendary titans of Sinnoh Dialga, Palkia and Giratina (all three Pokemon appear together in this game for the first time).</li>
