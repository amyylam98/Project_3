    <h4>Official Description:</h4>
    <p> Emerald takes place over land and sea and pits you against the Team Aqua and Team Magma from Saphire and Ruby. 
        This time around, Pokemon will show off their moves prior to battle, perhaps as a sort of taunt. 
        Nintendo also added some new options to the game. A new Battle Frontier area has you play through seven big battles. 
        The Battle Dome places you in a tournament in which only three Pokemon can participate. 
        The Battle Tube has you select from three entrances and attempt to make your way to a goal.
