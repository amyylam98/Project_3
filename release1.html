    <h4>Official Description:</h4>
    <p> You've finally been granted your Pokemon trainer's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer. 
        It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pokemon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. 
        Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. 
        Trade with friends and watch your Pokemon evolve. Important - no single Pokemon can win it all. 
        Can you develop the ultimate Pokemon strategy to defeat the 8 GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pokemon Master of all time?
