    <p> You've finally been granted your Pokemon trainer's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer. 
        It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pokemon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. 
        Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. 
        Trade with friends and watch your Pokemon evolve. Important - no single Pokemon can win it all. 
        Can you develop the ultimate Pokemon strategy to defeat the 8 GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pokemon Master of all time?

        This time around, Pokemon will show off their moves prior to battle, perhaps as a sort of taunt. 
        Nintendo also added some new options to the game. A new Battle Frontier area has you play through seven big battles. 
        The Battle Dome places you in a tournament in which only three Pokemon can participate. 
        The Battle Tube has you select from three entrances and attempt to make your way to a goal.

    <p> Pokemon technology will make its next quantum leap. We've seen the future, and it's all about Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen. 
        The new games are set in Kanto, the region where Pokemon first took root and exploded into a major phenomenon, and the latest titles stuff in tons of exciting new features. 
        One thing's for certain: when Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen get into Trainers' hands, Pokemon fans stand to become the coolest, most connected gaming community in the world.

        The other is called Palkia, who is said to have the ability to distort space. 
        The sinister organization called Team Galaxy is trying to rule the region by utilizing these two Pokemon's power.

    <p> As the story unfolds, players will encounter the mysterious new Distortion World, an area unlike any seen in a Pokemon video game before. 
        The Battle Frontier area (first introduced in Pokemon Emerald) has been added to Sinnoh, containing five new Battle Facilities for Trainers to challenge, each with its own special rules. 
        Players can explore the new Wi-Fi Plaza a virtual Pokemon amusement park filled with activities, including three new mini-games where up to 4 players can compete at once.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Distortion World</b>: As the story unfolds, players will encounter the mysterious new Distortion World, an area unlike any seen in a Pokemon video game before. The normal rules of time and space don't apply to this world, allowing the area to push the limits of the Pokemon game world. Players leap from pieces of land suspended in midair, walk sideways and even upside-down. The Distortion World, where the powerful Giratina resides, is somehow connected to the regular Pokemon world.</li>
        <li><b>The Battle Frontier</b>: The Battle Frontier area (first introduced in Pokemon Emerald) has been added to Sinnoh, containing five new Battle Facilities for Trainers to challenge, each with its own special rules. Each facility is run by one of five new Frontier Brains (characters that are similar to Gym Leaders). The new battle formats in each facility allow players to challenge themselves in new ways.</li>
        <li><b>Wi-Fi Plaza</b>: Players can explore the new Wi-Fi Plaza a virtual Pokemon amusement park filled with activities, including three new mini-games where up to 4 players can compete at once. Up to 20 players from around the world can connect together in the Wi-Fi Plaza to experience games, take part in parades and even see a fireworks show.</li>
        <li><b>Enhanced Storyline</b>: New characters add to the story, including Charon, a new Commander of the villainous Team Galactic (who is suspicious even by their standards) and an undercover detective, codenamed Looker, who is in pursuit of Team Galactic. Looker will help you throughout your adventure. Team Galactic has a new scheme they've turned their sights on all three Legendary titans of Sinnoh Dialga, Palkia and Giratina (all three Pokemon appear together in this game for the first time).</li>

        For example, the Legendary Pokemon Reshiram can only be caught in Pokemon Black Version, while the Legendary Pokemon Zekrom can only be caught in Pokemon White Version. 
        Additionally, the two games feature different areas for the first time in the series, with the game world of Pokemon Black Version featuring a unique metropolitan area called Black City, and a lush, green area named White Forest only found in Pokemon White Version. 
        Pokemon Black Version and Pokemon White Version also mark the first time in a Pokemon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokemon appear more frequently during different seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The games feature more than 150 never-before-seen Pokemon, more than any previous Pokemon video game has introduced. Until players complete the main adventure, they will only encounter these new Pokemon, creating a new experience that series fans and newcomers alike can enjoy for the first time.</li>
        <li>Players assume the role of a young Pokemon Trainer who travels throughout the Unova region, catching and training Pokemon and battling other Trainers on a quest to become the Pokemon League Champion.

        <li>Using IR technology that is built into the game card, it's faster than ever to set up battles and trades with nearby friends.</li>
        <li>The in-game Xtransceiver lets players using a Nintendo DSi or Nintendo DSi XL system connect via video chat using the system's camera. Up to four players can use the service locally, or two can use it via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (each player needs his or her own system).</li>
        <li>The games mark the first time in a Pokemon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokemon appear more frequently during particular seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.</li>

    <p> In the game, you start out as a brand-new Pokemon Trainer. 
        You'll meet, catch, and raise many Pokemon on your journey to improve your skills and become the best Pokemon Trainer that you can be. 
        Along the way, you'll help all sorts of people and thwart the dastardly plans of those who wish to take advantage of Pokemon for their nefarious ends. 
        Of course, you can't accomplish this alone—you'll need to work with your partner Pikachu or partner Eevee along with the rest of your Pokemon allies!
        You'll meet either Pikachu or Eevee when you begin your adventure. 
        Pikachu or Eevee will be your partner throughout your adventure and grow with you. 
        Unlike regular Pokemon, your partner prefers to be out of its Poke Ball, so it will stay with you by hanging on your shoulder or riding on your head. 
        It also seems to have no interest in evolving!

    <h4>Official Description:</h4>
    <p> In the game, you start out as a brand-new Pokemon Trainer. 
        You'll meet, catch, and raise many Pokemon on your journey to improve your skills and become the best Pokemon Trainer that you can be. 
        Along the way, you'll help all sorts of people and thwart the dastardly plans of those who wish to take advantage of Pokemon for their nefarious ends. 
        Of course, you can't accomplish this alone—you'll need to work with your partner Pikachu or partner Eevee along with the rest of your Pokemon allies!
        You'll meet either Pikachu or Eevee when you begin your adventure. 
        Pikachu or Eevee will be your partner throughout your adventure and grow with you. 
        Unlike regular Pokemon, your partner prefers to be out of its Poke Ball, so it will stay with you by hanging on your shoulder or riding on your head. 
        It also seems to have no interest in evolving!
