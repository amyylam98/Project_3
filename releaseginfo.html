    <p> Emerald takes place over land and sea and pits you against the Team Aqua and Team Magma from Saphire and Ruby. 
        This time around, Pokémon will show off their moves prior to battle, perhaps as a sort of taunt. 
        Nintendo also added some new options to the game. A new Battle Frontier area has you play through seven big battles. 
        The Battle Dome places you in a tournament in which only three Pokémon can participate. 
        The Battle Tube has you select from three entrances and attempt to make your way to a goal.

    <p> As the story unfolds, players will encounter the mysterious new Distortion World, an area unlike any seen in a Pokémon video game before. 
        The Battle Frontier area (first introduced in Pokémon Emerald) has been added to Sinnoh, containing five new Battle Facilities for Trainers to challenge, each with its own special rules. 
        Players can explore the new Wi-Fi Plaza a virtual Pokémon amusement park filled with activities, including three new mini-games where up to 4 players can compete at once.

        <li><b>Distortion World</b>: As the story unfolds, players will encounter the mysterious new Distortion World, an area unlike any seen in a Pokémon video game before. The normal rules of time and space don't apply to this world, allowing the area to push the limits of the Pokémon game world. Players leap from pieces of land suspended in midair, walk sideways and even upside-down. The Distortion World, where the powerful Giratina resides, is somehow connected to the regular Pokémon world.</li>
        <li><b>The Battle Frontier</b>: The Battle Frontier area (first introduced in Pokémon Emerald) has been added to Sinnoh, containing five new Battle Facilities for Trainers to challenge, each with its own special rules. Each facility is run by one of five new Frontier Brains (characters that are similar to Gym Leaders). The new battle formats in each facility allow players to challenge themselves in new ways.</li>
        <li><b>Wi-Fi Plaza</b>: Players can explore the new Wi-Fi Plaza a virtual Pokémon amusement park filled with activities, including three new mini-games where up to 4 players can compete at once. Up to 20 players from around the world can connect together in the Wi-Fi Plaza to experience games, take part in parades and even see a fireworks show.</li>
        <li><b>Enhanced Storyline</b>: New characters add to the story, including Charon, a new Commander of the villainous Team Galactic (who is suspicious even by their standards) and an undercover detective, codenamed Looker, who is in pursuit of Team Galactic. Looker will help you throughout your adventure. Team Galactic has a new scheme they've turned their sights on all three Legendary titans of Sinnoh Dialga, Palkia and Giratina (all three Pokémon appear together in this game for the first time).</li>

    <p> Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version feature new Pokémon that players can catch, train and battle as they progress through the game, and some Pokémon can only be caught in one version of the game. 
        For example, the Legendary Pokémon Reshiram can only be caught in Pokémon Black Version, while the Legendary Pokémon Zekrom can only be caught in Pokémon White Version. 
        Additionally, the two games feature different areas for the first time in the series, with the game world of Pokémon Black Version featuring a unique metropolitan area called Black City, and a lush, green area named White Forest only found in Pokémon White Version. 
        Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version also mark the first time in a Pokémon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokémon appear more frequently during different seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The games feature more than 150 never-before-seen Pokémon, more than any previous Pokémon video game has introduced. Until players complete the main adventure, they will only encounter these new Pokémon, creating a new experience that series fans and newcomers alike can enjoy for the first time.</li>
        <li>Players assume the role of a young Pokémon Trainer who travels throughout the Unova region, catching and training Pokémon and battling other Trainers on a quest to become the Pokémon League Champion. Players must defeat other powerful Trainers while working to uncover the plans of the mysterious Team Plasma.</li>
        <li>The in-game high-tech C-Gear lets players easily connect in a variety of ways. The C-Gear can connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and sync with the Pokémon Global Link. When users are playing locally, they can use the C-Gear to trade Friend Codes, trade Pokémon and battle seamlessly.</li>
        <li>Using IR technology that is built into the game card, it's faster than ever to set up battles and trades with nearby friends.</li>
        <li>The in-game Xtransceiver lets players using a Nintendo DSi or Nintendo DSi XL system connect via video chat using the system's camera. Up to four players can use the service locally, or two can use it via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (each player needs his or her own system).</li>
        <li>The games mark the first time in a Pokémon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokémon appear more frequently during particular seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.</li>
        <li>The Pokémon Global Link lets players save their game data to a website and enjoy their Pokémon outside of the game. When accessing the Pokémon Global Link, players can visit and customize the Pokémon Dream World to play minigames and watch their Pokémon's dreams; they can access the Global Battle Union to view their world ranking; and they can connect to the Global Trade Station, which lets them view their trades with other players.</li>
        <li>In a series first, the two games feature different areas. The game world of Pokémon Black Version features a unique metropolitan area called Black City, while the lush, green area called White Forest is only found in Pokémon White Version. Some Pokémon are unique to one version of the game.</li>

        For example, the Legendary Pokémon Reshiram can only be caught in Pokémon Black Version, while the Legendary Pokémon Zekrom can only be caught in Pokémon White Version. 
        Additionally, the two games feature different areas for the first time in the series, with the game world of Pokémon Black Version featuring a unique metropolitan area called Black City, and a lush, green area named White Forest only found in Pokémon White Version. 
        Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version also mark the first time in a Pokémon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokémon appear more frequently during different seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The games feature more than 150 never-before-seen Pokémon, more than any previous Pokémon video game has introduced. Until players complete the main adventure, they will only encounter these new Pokémon, creating a new experience that series fans and newcomers alike can enjoy for the first time.</li>
        <li>Players assume the role of a young Pokémon Trainer who travels throughout the Unova region, catching and training Pokémon and battling other Trainers on a quest to become the Pokémon League Champion. Players must defeat other powerful Trainers while working to uncover the plans of the mysterious Team Plasma.</li>
        <li>The in-game high-tech C-Gear lets players easily connect in a variety of ways. The C-Gear can connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and sync with the Pokémon Global Link. When users are playing locally, they can use the C-Gear to trade Friend Codes, trade Pokémon and battle seamlessly.</li>
        <li>Using IR technology that is built into the game card, it's faster than ever to set up battles and trades with nearby friends.</li>
        <li>The in-game Xtransceiver lets players using a Nintendo DSi or Nintendo DSi XL system connect via video chat using the system's camera. Up to four players can use the service locally, or two can use it via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (each player needs his or her own system).</li>
        <li>The games mark the first time in a Pokémon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokémon appear more frequently during particular seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.</li>
        <li>The Pokémon Global Link lets players save their game data to a website and enjoy their Pokémon outside of the game. When accessing the Pokémon Global Link, players can visit and customize the Pokémon Dream World to play minigames and watch their Pokémon's dreams; they can access the Global Battle Union to view their world ranking; and they can connect to the Global Trade Station, which lets them view their trades with other players.</li>
        <li>In a series first, the two games feature different areas. The game world of Pokémon Black Version features a unique metropolitan area called Black City, while the lush, green area called White Forest is only found in Pokémon White Version. Some Pokémon are unique to one version of the game.</li>

    <p> In the game, you start out as a brand-new Pokémon Trainer. 
        You'll meet, catch, and raise many Pokémon on your journey to improve your skills and become the best Pokémon Trainer that you can be. 
        Along the way, you'll help all sorts of people and thwart the dastardly plans of those who wish to take advantage of Pokémon for their nefarious ends. 
        Of course, you can't accomplish this alone—you'll need to work with your partner Pikachu or partner Eevee along with the rest of your Pokémon allies!
        You'll meet either Pikachu or Eevee when you begin your adventure. 
        Pikachu or Eevee will be your partner throughout your adventure and grow with you. 
        Unlike regular Pokémon, your partner prefers to be out of its Poke Ball, so it will stay with you by hanging on your shoulder or riding on your head. 
        It also seems to have no interest in evolving!
