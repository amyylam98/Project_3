    <h4>Official Description:</h4>
    <p> Pokemon Black Version and Pokemon White Version feature new Pokemon that players can catch, train and battle as they progress through the game, and some Pokemon can only be caught in one version of the game. 
        For example, the Legendary Pokemon Reshiram can only be caught in Pokemon Black Version, while the Legendary Pokemon Zekrom can only be caught in Pokemon White Version. 
        Additionally, the two games feature different areas for the first time in the series, with the game world of Pokemon Black Version featuring a unique metropolitan area called Black City, and a lush, green area named White Forest only found in Pokemon White Version. 
        Pokemon Black Version and Pokemon White Version also mark the first time in a Pokemon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokemon appear more frequently during different seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The games feature more than 150 never-before-seen Pokemon, more than any previous Pokemon video game has introduced. Until players complete the main adventure, they will only encounter these new Pokemon, creating a new experience that series fans and newcomers alike can enjoy for the first time.</li>
        <li>Players assume the role of a young Pokemon Trainer who travels throughout the Unova region, catching and training Pokemon and battling other Trainers on a quest to become the Pokemon League Champion. Players must defeat other powerful Trainers while working to uncover the plans of the mysterious Team Plasma.</li>
        <li>The in-game high-tech C-Gear lets players easily connect in a variety of ways. The C-Gear can connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and sync with the Pokemon Global Link. When users are playing locally, they can use the C-Gear to trade Friend Codes, trade Pokemon and battle seamlessly.</li>
        <li>Using IR technology that is built into the game card, it's faster than ever to set up battles and trades with nearby friends.</li>
        <li>The in-game Xtransceiver lets players using a Nintendo DSi or Nintendo DSi XL system connect via video chat using the system's camera. Up to four players can use the service locally, or two can use it via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (each player needs his or her own system).</li>
        <li>The games mark the first time in a Pokemon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokemon appear more frequently during particular seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.</li>
        <li>The Pokemon Global Link lets players save their game data to a website and enjoy their Pokemon outside of the game. When accessing the Pokemon Global Link, players can visit and customize the Pokemon Dream World to play minigames and watch their Pokemon's dreams; they can access the Global Battle Union to view their world ranking; and they can connect to the Global Trade Station, which lets them view their trades with other players.</li>
        <li>In a series first, the two games feature different areas. The game world of Pokemon Black Version features a unique metropolitan area called Black City, while the lush, green area called White Forest is only found in Pokemon White Version. Some Pokemon are unique to one version of the game.</li>
