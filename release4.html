    <h4>Official Description:</h4>
    <p> Pokemon technology will make its next quantum leap. We've seen the future, and it's all about Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen. 
        The new games are set in Kanto, the region where Pokemon first took root and exploded into a major phenomenon, and the latest titles stuff in tons of exciting new features. 
        One thing's for certain: when Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen get into Trainers' hands, Pokemon fans stand to become the coolest, most connected gaming community in the world.
