    <h4>Official Description:</h4>
    <p> Return to the beloved Johto region first introduced in the Pokémon Gold and Silver Version games for the portable Game Boy™ system. 
        Several new enhancements for the series, such as updated graphics and touch screen features, and enrich these timeless adventures. 
        Both games feature detailed graphics that spotlight the unique environments and hundreds of Pokémon that players can encounter and catch. 
        Players can even see and interact with their favorite Pokémon outside of battle, selecting one from their team to follow behind them as they travel through the Johto region.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Players become a Pokémon Trainer, traveling from town to town across the Johto region on an adventure to catch, train and battle Pokémon.</li>
        <li>For the first time, any Pokémon can follow players on their journey outside of the Poké Ball. Your favorite Pokémon can always be at your side! (Pokewalker not included).</li>
        <li>Players with a wireless broadband connection can interact with their friends who have either the Pokémon HeartGold or SoulSilver Version game to trade or battle Pokémon via the Nintendo® Wi-Fi Connection service. Players can also battle and trade with others via a local wireless connection.</li>
        <li>An internal clock keeps track of the time of day and the day of the week. Some special events will only happen on certain days or at certain times of day.</li>
