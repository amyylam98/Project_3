    <h4>Official Description:</h4>
    <p> In the game, you start out as a brand-new Pokemon Trainer. 
        You'll meet, catch, and raise many Pokemon on your journey to improve your skills and become the best Pokemon Trainer that you can be. 
        Along the way, you'll help all sorts of people and thwart the dastardly plans of those who wish to take advantage of Pokemon for their nefarious ends. 
        Of course, you can't accomplish this alone—you'll need to work with your partner Pikachu or partner Eevee along with the rest of your Pokemon allies!
        You'll meet either Pikachu or Eevee when you begin your adventure. 
        Pikachu or Eevee will be your partner throughout your adventure and grow with you. 
        Unlike regular Pokemon, your partner prefers to be out of its Poke Ball, so it will stay with you by hanging on your shoulder or riding on your head. 
        It also seems to have no interest in evolving!
